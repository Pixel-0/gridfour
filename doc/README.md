The algorithms used in G93 have been around for a long time
They were originally developed for a project named Gem93 that was
completed in 1993 (we've named our file format "G93" in its honor).  Gem93 included 
a number of tools for working with raster data, among them a data compression technique
inspired by the work of Kidner and Smith (1992). You can read more about them at our wiki page
[G93 Compression Algorithms](https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour/wiki/G93-Compression-Algorithms).
